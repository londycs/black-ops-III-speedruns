1. money for rolling gums during run
2. spawns powerup for control over rocket launch

start ranked game so total bows = player count rather than doing all 4 bows regardless of player count

## start
reset for richtofen, as you can quote skip (~10s save) during moon explosion 

hit gum for reign drops, enable landing pad

pop reign drops #1 + nuke round 1 at ~18.5s to end round as you rotate to church

## dragon #1
> all 3 dragons require 8 zombie kills

pop reign drops #2 in church + hit box for xm-53, if not then keep mr6 

<img width="1626" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec839bcc-64d1-4ca9-a4ed-dd821e1f4df0" />

fill dragon #1, turn on power

## dragon #2
rotate to dragon #2 + buy both drop downs & door to sam's for faster spawns

<img width="1428" height="1439" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9de80d0-e2d9-4922-bbcf-dce7fb713745" />

hit gum for ABH, nuke after 5th kill if nuke before ABH

rotate to final dragon as round flips to 4

## dragon #3

feed dragon #3, turn on anti-grav ASAP *if confident in bonfires to make anti-grav cycle* or leave a pad 

<img width="1970" height="1438" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77bd615d-6577-49a9-a9ba-854a0f3dc239" />

finish dragon #3 and grab bow

## lightning bow
round 5 dogs > round 6 dogs (~30s loss with the latter)

if round 5 dogs, end round while shooting bonfires

if round 5 zombies, don't kill anything to use for urns

after wall run, teleport for the first time

## crackle
> all urns require 5 zombie kills

post teleport, hit gum for ABH and turn on landing pad

fill urn and shoot bonfire 

post bonfire, ABH and rotate to double tap urn *unless given 1 of 2 ABHs close to clocktower*

two in one the bonfires with the double tap urn or do double tap then clocktower (don't leave clocktower until round flips or despawns)

try to set rocket off with a drop pre round 6 flip

ABH after grabbing upgraded arrow if a use is left

shoot teleporter to start wisp before upgrading bow

## wisps #1
> wisps always come in sets of 4, with wisp #1 being random, and the next wisp being a 50/50 chance between the two closest wisps, with another wisp being added with each additional player (ex. 2 players, 33/33/33)

<img width="385" height="157" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e994c501-02f3-4fb6-80b2-095417bd4d9a" />

during wisp sequence #1, roll gum for powerup between spawns

teleport post sequence #1, and grab fuses + canister + vault code

post back in time (BIT) #1, start rocket and grab rag part (ignore panzer, will get part during keeper)

roll gum for ABH during rocket launch

ABH post-rag part

## wisps #2
> lots going on during wisp sequence #2, you want to be calling dempsey down with the deathray + vault code + simon says + wisp sequence #2 all simultaneously

> wisp sequence #1 and wisp sequence #2 are independent of eachother

> simon says #1 takes 7, simon says #2 takes 8

put in fuses + flip switch + enter vault code **WHILE CHECKING WISP LOCATIONS ON THE WAY**

grab vault part with 1-3 wisps shot, but don't go out of way for more than 1

add vault part to deathray and flip switch again + jump to rocket for simon says #1, shooting wisp during if possible, otherwise can ABH 

shoot final wisp + do simon says #2 while thinning round to 1 zombie

call dempsey with deathray + jump to rocket, ending round as you jump (risky) or waiting until back from BIT #2

teleport + enter keycard + grab tablet

post BIT #2, grab golden rod and start keeper step

## keeper

> keeper takes 20 zombie kills

> nuke on round end to force keeper to move faster, using timing sheet to nuke as last zombie spawns assuming 1. no despawns 2. haven't hit horde cap

> round timer starts as soon as round flips and Survive xp shows on screen

<img width="466" height="678" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98fc3d3a-3373-438a-9132-1721f8541adc" />

use nukes + reign drops to end keeper rounds, but cycle back to reign drops for boss

if at double tap and keeper hasn't gone mule kick, open spawn door to give faster route

if no deathray rag part still, grab between rounds during rotates

get ragnarok part from panzer during keeper #4

## boss

> reign drops for death machines to kill panzers during 2nd and 3rd phases

enter boss by ragnaroking blue squares

if keeper dog attack, kill dogs as fast as possible

post-boss, before white screen shoot a charged lightning bow shot at the floor 

during white screen, when you no longer hear bow shot, move forwards and spam interact as richtofen to grab summoning key during white screen

place key on console near death ray + down yourself after "you've stopped nothing" quote right before rockets hit the moon
